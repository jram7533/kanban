 Basic working Kanban board

I started this as a project to improve my mastery of JavaScript and jQuery. Now, after many days' work, it's working and, as far as I can tell, error-free

Jobs are stored as cards in a flat-file format. When a card is added/updated, the data file is also updated. I had one glitch during testing, where the data file and table mysteriously disappeared, but I haven't been able to replicate it
